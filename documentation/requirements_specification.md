# Requirements Specification

## Purpose of the application
My application is a derivative and integral calculator to help users with solving their necessary mathematical equations. It can be used by several registered users, who can keep track of equations they have previously entered if they wish to do so.

## Users
There is a regular user role, where the current user can create an account, and later log in to it using their credentials. The user can only access their information.

This will initially be done with a text interface, but will hopefully later be a graphical user interface.
An extension could be an administrative role, where the root user can delete and access all the other accounts.

## Functionalities

### Basic functionalities
- At first, the user logs in.
  - The user is asked if they wish to review previous equations, if they wish to find a derivative or a new equation, or if they wish to find an integral of an equation.
  - If they wish to review previous equations:
     - fgf

### Further development ideas
The original function will be graphed along with the derivative/integral.
Every separate user has a special space where they can add notes/comments to themselves (about a particular equation or topic in general).
